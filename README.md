2. Problem Statement
~Farm Resource Allocation and Optimization
~Problem Description
  Farmers currently use experience and intuition to make decisions regarding farm resource allocation. However, farm resource allocation is a complex problem that includes multiple interdependent factors like land size, availability of water, soil types, weather, and market demands. Farmers currently do not use any decision-making tools to make farm resource allocation decisions. As a result, farm resources are being allocated inefficiently, causing lower yields, increasing costs, and reducing profitability.

*Target Users
~Small and medium-scale farmers
~Agricultural planners
~Rural development organizations
*Existing Gaps
~No available farm resource allocation and optimization tools
~No integration of environmental and economic factors
~Excessive manual decision-making
~No visualization and insights

3. Problem Understanding & Approach
~Root Cause Analysis
~Decisions are made based on experience
~Balancing multiple variables is challenging
~No available decision-making tools

4.Solution Strategy
~Plentica will use a hybrid approach that includes constraint filtering, multiple-factor scoring, and greedy optimization. This will ensure that land, water, and other farm resources are allocated efficiently and maximum profit is achieved.

5. Proposed Solution
~Solution Overview
The intelligent decision support system named Plentica assists farmers in optimizing crop planning and irrigation through environmental and economic factors.
~Core Idea
The application would analyze user input and create an optimal crop plan by balancing the constraints and maximizing the profit.
Key Features
1] Smart Crop Allocation
2] Water Optimization
3]Soil-Aware Planning
4] Climate & Rainfall Integration
5] Economic Optimization
6] Interactive Dashboard

6. System Architecture
High-Level Flow
User → Frontend → Processing Logic → Dataset → Output → Dashboard
Architecture Description
User input is taken through the frontend.
The backend processes the input data through filtering and optimization.
A dataset is used to map the suitability of crops and the profit.
The output is sent back through the frontend.
The dashboard is used for visualization.
